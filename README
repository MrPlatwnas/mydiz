Our code is implemented in C language. In order to compile it, a configuration file for the make utility is
provided, named Makefile. 

You can run mydiz with the following flags:

-c 
In order to create the .di compressed file that flattens all the directories inside and keeps a di-node-list that has all the paths informations. It its followed with all the directories and files to be compressed

-x
In order to uncompress the .di file bringing in the current working directory all the files and directories in their original form.

-j
All the files that are kept in our .di compressed file are first compressed and then stored, this flag goes with -c.

-m
With this flag you can see the DiNode , the permissions , the owener and group of every file and directory that exists in the .di file.

-q

Followed by a list of arguments it answers if the the names of files and directories int the list exists in the .di file.

-p

It prints in an easily understanble way the hierarchy of the directories and files that are kept inside the   .di compressed file.

-a
We didn't finished the -a but we have created the " make space " function that operates efficiently and creates space in the middle for and grows the file in order to add more inside.

-d
As it is optional we didn't impelmented.

At the directory meta_data you will find all the functions that operate low level and are responsible for our interface with the file .di.

Recurssion was very useful in our functions we used mostly the idea of DFS.
